In the context of object-oriented programming (I) What is inheritance? (II) What is polymorphism? (III) What is encapsulation? (6 points)
Inheritance means the new class acquires the properties of the base class.
Polymorphism means inherited methods can be overridden to perform different tasks.
Encapsulation means that only trusted members can access private data.



9.  What is the main difference between the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow and the “Integration manager” workflow? (5 points)
The lieutenant between the dictator on developer is the main difference. The integration manager handles the roles of both dictator and lieutenant.

10. How would a team of 100 developers benefit from following the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow instead of the “Centralized” workflow? (5 points)
There are two levels of supervision before anything gets to the blessed repository. At a large scale such as 100 developers, this would prevent corruption in the repository that everyone is drawing from.
